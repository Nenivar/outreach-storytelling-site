1.  Moving an emoji
    
    Now that we have our characters, the next best step is making them do something.

    Scenes contain a series of **action**s, which can dictate various things (such as moving an emoji or displaying some text).

    Add this code below what you've written:
    ```python
    newScene.addAction(ActionMove(1000, emoji1, Vector2(300, 400)))
    ```

    You should now see an the laughing emoji move across the scene.

2.  Movement 

    Let's dissect what this line of code does.
    
    An **ActionMove** is created through 3 parameters:
    * the amount of time the action lasts (in this case, ```1000```)
    * the emoji which will be moving (in this case, ```emoji1```)
    * the position the emoji will move to (in this case, ```Vector2(300, 400))```

    Try changing some of the parameters and seeing what happens.

3.  Multiple movements

    When multiple actions are added to a scene, they will happen sequentially (one-after-another).

    To do this, just add another ```newScene.addAction(...)``` line.

    Try this out and see what happens (you should try using a different emoji too!)
