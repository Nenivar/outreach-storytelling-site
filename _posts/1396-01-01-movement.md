1.  Moving an Emoji
    
    Now that we have our characters, the next step is making them do something.

    Add this code below the line containing `ActionWait`:

    ```python
    newScene.addAction(ActionMove(1000, emoji1, Vector2(100, 400)))
    ```

    ![arrow_down]

    ![It moved!](/assets/images/contrib/movement/movement.png){: .center}

    You should now see the laughing **Emoji** downwards, to the position `(100, 400)`.

    > Let's break down how we construct `ActionMove`:
    > ```python
    > ActionMove(duration, emoji, position)
    > ```
    > The **Action** tells the **Scene** to move an `Emoji` from its current position to a new `position` in `duration` seconds.
    > Try changing the numbers and see what happens!

3.  Multiple Movements

    Let's make the shocked **Emoji** move to the position `(200, 300)` after the laughing one does, in *2 seconds*.

    To do this, add another ```newScene.addAction(...)``` line below the one you just added.

    Try to figure out how to do this yourself!

4.  Scaling

    Another **Action** we can use is `ActionScale`.

    Here's how you can construct it. Try using it and seeing what happens:

    ```python
    ActionScale(duration, emoji, scale)
    ```
    i.e:
    ```python
    ActionScale(500, emoji1, 2)
    ```
    Will scale *emoji1* by a factor of *2* in *500* milliseconds (half a second).
