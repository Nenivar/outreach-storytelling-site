Now that we've got the basics down, try to make your own story by combining different actions together.

Why not try:

* a race
* a dog growing far too big
* moving in a circle
* a stroll through a forest
* dinner at a restaurant

> You might want to display some background objects (i.e. trees) - to do this, just add the emoji to the scene (you don't **need** to add any actions!) 

There's a list of available `Emoji` images and `Action`s [here](/reference){:target="_blank"}. It has a few which I haven't mentioned before - take a look!

**Have fun, and remember to ask for help if you get stuck!**
