1.  Opening Trinket

    Open [this site](https://trinket.io/pygame/64db0d89fb){:target="_blank"} - we'll be writing and executing all of our code here.

    > If this site is already open on the right side of your screen then don't worry about this.

    You should see something like this:

    ![Intial Trinket View](/assets/images/contrib/trinket/trinket_0.png)

    On the left you have the **IDE**, which you will be writing code in.

    Your **code** will execute on the right, when *Run* is clicked - give it a click and see what happens.

    ## INSERT IMAGE

    You should see 'INSERT' printed in the console.

    > The *'Run'* button on the right will disappear after you click it - click the play symbol in the top-left of the editor to execute the code from now on.

2.  Where we write code

    Scroll down on the **left** to the end.
    
    We'll be writing all of our code below the '*WRITE YOUR CODE...*' comment (on **line 88**).

    ## TODO: replace this when abstraction layer between front & backend is done

    With all code you copy from this site, make sure you write it **exactly as it is shown**. This is important, else your code might not compile and you'll get an error.
