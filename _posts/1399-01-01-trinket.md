1.  Opening Trinket

    Open [this site](https://trinket.io/pygame/64db0d89fb){:target="_blank"} - we'll be writing and executing all of our code here.

    > If this site is already open on the right side of your screen then don't worry about this.

    You should see something like this:

    ![Intial Trinket View](/assets/images/contrib/trinket/trinket_0.png){: width="400px" .center}

    On the left you have the **editor**, which you will be writing code in.

    Your code will be executed & **displayed** on the right.

2.  Where We Write Code
    
    We'll be writing all of our code inside the **editor**, below the '`WRITE YOUR CODE HERE`' comment (on **line 17**), inside the `def setup(game: Game):` function.

    ![Editor View](/assets/images/contrib/trinket/trinket_1.png){: .center}

    With all code you copy from this site, make sure you write it **exactly as it is shown**. This is important, else your code might not compile and you'll get an error.

3.  Executing Code

    Click the *Run* button on the right to execute your code (which currently prints *"Hello World!"*)

    If you look on the right you'll see a black square appear for a bit, then below that some text.

    > The *'Run'* button on the right will disappear after you click it - click the play symbol in the top-left of the editor to execute the code from now on.
