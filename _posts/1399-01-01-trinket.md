1.  Opening Trinket

    Open [this site](https://trinket.io/pygame/64db0d89fb) - we'll be writing and executing all of our code here.

    You should see something like this:

    ![Intial Trinket View](/assets/images/contrib/trinket/trinket_0.png)

    On the left you have the **IDE**, which you will be writing code in.

    Your **code** will execute on the right.

2.  Where we write code

    Scroll down on the **left** to the end.
    
    We'll be writing all of our code below the '*WRITE YOUR CODE...*' comment (on **line 88**).

    With all code, make sure you write it **exactly as it is shown**. This important, else your code won't compile and you'll get an error.
