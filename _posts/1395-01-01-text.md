1.  Displaying Text

    No story is complete without dialog (sorry to any mimes out there).

    We do through through using `ActionText`:

    ```python
    ActionText(duration, words)
    ```
    i.e:
    ```python
    ActionText(1200, "Hello!")
    ```

    ![How's it going?](/assets/images/contrib/text/text.png){: .center}

    Try adding this to a scene!

2.  Displaying Emotion

    You can change the image of an **Emoji** with `ActionChange`:

    ```python
    ActionChange(emoji, image_name)
    ```
    i.e:
    ```python
    ActionChange(emoji1, 'unimpressed')
    ```
