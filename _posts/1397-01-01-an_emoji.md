title: Making an emoji
chapter: IV

1.  Adding an emoji

    If we want an interesting story, we need to have some characters.
    
    These characters are going to be **emojis**.

    Add this code below the code you wrote last chapter:

    ```python
    emoji1 = Emoji('laughing')
    newScene.addEmoji(emoji1)
    ```

    Run the code again (just like last time). You should see a laughing emoji in the top left corner of the screen.

2.  Multiple emoji

    We can add multiple emojis if we add some more code.

    Add this below the previous code:

    ```python
    emoji2 = Emoji('shocked')
    newScene.addEmoji(emoji2)
    ```

    You should now see a shocked emoji on top of the other one.
