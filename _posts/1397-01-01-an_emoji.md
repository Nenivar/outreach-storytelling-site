1.  Adding an Emoji

    If we want an interesting story, we need to have some characters.
    
    These characters are going to be **Emojis**.

    Add this code below `newScene.setBackgroundColor(COL_BLUE)` and above `game.addScene(newScene)`:

    ```python
    emoji1 = Emoji('laughing')
    newScene.addEmoji(emoji1)
    ```

    > Your code should now look like this:
    > 
    > ![Code view](/assets/images/contrib/emoji/emoji.png)

    This will add a laughing emoji to the **Scene**, but executing the code will not show anything. This is because there aren't any **Actions** included in the **Scene**.

2.  Moving Your Emoji

    A **Scene** contains a series of **Actions** which are executed one-after-another. There are a few different **Actions** we'll go over today, the first of which is `ActionWait`.
    
    Let's add an `ActionWait` to the Scene so we can see what's happening.

    ```python
    ...
    newScene.addEmoji(emoji1)

    newScene.addAction(ActionWait(1000))

    game.addScene(newScene)
    ...
    ```

    `ActionWait` causes the **Scene** to be paused for a bit.

    > Want to make the wait longer? Adjust the `1000` in `ActionWait(1000)` to another amount.
    > 
    > The `1000` represents 1000 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 1 second. So, for example, if you wanted 1.5 seconds you could change `1000` to `1500`.

3.  Emoji Position

    Each **Emoji** has their own position, (x,y) - how far along the *x-axis* it is, and how far along the *y-axis* it is.

    When you create an **Emoji**, it starts at `(0,0)` by default. We can change this by giving our own position:

    ```python
    emoji1 = Emoji('laughing', Vector2(100, 200))
    ```

    ![arrow_down]

    ![Moved laughing emoji](/assets/images/contrib/emoji/emoji_2.png)

    The **Emoji** should now start at the position `(100, 200)`

    > The screen's total size is `(480,480)`. This will be useful when moving **Emojis**!

4.  Multiple Emojis

    Now we understand how to add one **Emoji** to our **Scene**, it's easy to add more.

    Add this below `newScene.addEmoji(emoji1)`:

    ```python
    emoji2 = Emoji('shocked', Vector2(300, 200))
    newScene.addEmoji(emoji2)
    ```

    ![arrow_down]

    ![Two emoji!](/assets/images/contrib/emoji/emoji_3.png){: .center}

    You should now see a shocked emoji in the **Scene** as well.

    > There are a few different emojis included for you to use, including:
    > * `'laughing'`
    > * `'shocked'`
    > * `'angry'`
    > * `'grin'`
    > * `'unimpressed'`
    > * `'smiling'`
    > * `'dog'`

    > Nothing working? Your code should look like this by now:
