1.  Making a scene

    Let's start off by creating a blank **scene** for our animation.

    This will hold all of our emojis, moves, and other properties.

    In where you were told to write code, **write** this & then **run** it:

    ```python
    def setup(game: Game) -> None:
        newScene = SceneAction()
        newScene.setBackgroundColour(COL_BLUE)

        game.addScene(newScene)
    ```

    ![arrow_down]

    ![Blue Screen](/assets/images/contrib/scene/scene.png){: height="600px" .center}

    If you managed to see the correct output - a short flash of a blue square - then good job, you've managed to make your first scene!

    If not, **make sure that you've copied down all the code correctly**.

2.  Scene Properties

    There are a few colours built into the program you can use to change the colour of the background:
    
    * `COL_WHITE`
    * `COL_BLACK`
    * `COL_RED`
    * `COL_BLUE`
    * `COL_GREEN`
    * `COL_YELLOW`
    * `COL_ORANGE`
    
    Try changing `COL_BLUE` in your code to one of these, then run it and see the colour change!

    > These variables are just shorthands for '**RGB**' (red, blue, green) values of the colours.
    > 
    > You can express a colour in **RGB** by describing the ratio of red:blue:green the colour is made of (think of it like mixing paint together).
    > 
    > For example, to create aqua you could write:
    > ```
    > COL_AQUA = (0, 255, 255)
    > ```
    > i.e. aqua is made with **no red**, and **equal parts blue & green**.
