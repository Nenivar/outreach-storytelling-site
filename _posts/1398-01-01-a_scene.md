1.  Making a scene

    Let's start off by creating a blank **scene** for our animation.

    This will hold all of our emojis, moves, and other properties.

    In where you were told to write code, write:

    ```python
    newScene = SceneAction()
    newScene.setBackgroundColour((220, 220, 220))

    g.addScene(newScene)
    ```

    This will create a **scene** with a gray background.

2.  Running your code

    If you click '*Run*' on the right-hand side, you should see a blank gray screen.

    This is a good basis for us to start on!
